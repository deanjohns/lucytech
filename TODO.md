- I used Axios as the API client to interact with the API. But with latest updates, we have React Query module and RTK Query module comes with Redux to interact with APIs with more enhancements than Axios like fallback handling, loader handling, side effects handling, etc. Here I used Axios to match to the scope of the test.

- I usually use Material UI for the JSX part with Grids, Boxes, FormControllers, etc. to make the UI more convenient, more readable and more simple to handle (in terms of the DOM and the styles with responsive). Here I didn't use it since the whole UI needs to be converted.

- Unit tests can be setup using Jest with "it", "expect" and "toBe\*" methods to ensure all the functions are working as expected.
